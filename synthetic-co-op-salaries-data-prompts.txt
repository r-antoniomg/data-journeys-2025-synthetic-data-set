# Prompts used for GPT-5 on Microsoft Copilot (University of Waterloo institutional instance) to generate a synthetic data set

## First prompt

- Create a new file called synthetic-co-op-salaries-data-v.0.0.csv
- Add the following columns:
 - Company / Role
 - Salary Information (CAD unless otherwise specified)
 - Benefits
 - Year
 - Position
- For now, do not add any values

## Second prompt

Update v.0.0 adding 500 values to the Company / Role column choosing among the following patterns:

[Company name]
[Company name] (Geographic location)
[Company name] (Geographic location Office)
[Company name] (role)
[Company name and role]
[Acronym company name] (Expanded acronym)

- Create fictional names for the companies, with names that sound like tech firms or government agencies.
- There may be some duplication in the company names
- Include inconsistencies in capitalization, as well as inconsistencies in parenthetical data. For example, a geographic location may be listed as (ON) or (Ontario), a role may be listed as (DEV) or (developer)
- Sort the Company / Role column alphabetically

Save the updated file using version number 0.1

## Third prompt

Open the file with version number 0.1
- Do not change any existing values or sorting

Make the following updates:

1) In the Salary info column, fill out a random 76% of entries, choosing from among these possible patterns:

[integer between 18 and 60]/hr
[float between 18.00 and 60.00]/hr
[integer between 18 and 60] USD/hr
[float between 18.00 and 60.00] USD/hr
[integer between 18 and 60]/hr USD
[float between 18.00 and 60.00]/hr USD

Using the above patterns, you may also include ranges as in the following example:

40-50/hr

2) Fill out a random 7% of entries choosing among these possible patterns:

[integer between 18 and 60]/hr
[float between 18.00 and 60.00]/hr
[integer between 18 and 60] USD/hr
[float between 18.00 and 60.00] USD/hr
[integer between 18 and 60]/hr USD
[float between 18.00 and 60.00]/hr USD

[integer between 1000 and 2000]/wk
[integer between 1000 and 2000]/week
[integer between 1000 and 2000] USD/wk
[integer between 1000 and 2000]/wk USD
[integer between 1000 and 2000] USD/week
[integer between 1000 and 2000]/week USD

[integer between 1800 and 17000]/mo
[integer between 1800 and 17000]/month
[integer between 1800 and 17000] USD/mo
[integer between 1800 and 17000] USD/month
[integer between 1800 and 17000]/mo USD
[integer between 1800 and 17000]/month USD

- For any of the patterns in sections 1 and 2 above, you may add parenthetical information using the pattern: ([ordinal number] coop)
 - example: 18/hr (1st coop)
 - keep the ordinal numbers between 1st and 6th

- For numbers equal to or higher than 1000, have inconsistent use of commas separating the thousands (example 1,000 or 1000)

Save the updated file using version number 0.2
